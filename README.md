# About Me
My name is Nick, and I am a **software engineering enthusiast**

I am passionate about using my creativity to design and develop minimalistic UIs for my clients, as well as my own projects. I am regularly looking for feedback that could help me strengthen my skills.

Experience with TypeScript, Node.js, and Discord.js has helped me develop multiple bots on a communication platform called [Discord](https://discord.com/).
